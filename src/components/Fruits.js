        <p>Fruits are a delightful and essential part of a healthy diet, each offering unique flavors and nutritional benefits. 
          Apples are incredibly versatile, perfect for everything from fresh snacks to delicious pies. Bananas provide a convenient source of potassium, supporting heart health and muscle function. Oranges, bursting with vitamin C, are excellent for boosting the immune system. Strawberries, with their antioxidant-rich properties, not only taste great but also help protect the body from free radicals. Mangoes, often hailed as the "king of fruits," offer a tropical sweetness and a wealth of vitamins. Grapes are equally versatile, enjoyed fresh, dried as raisins, or in the form of wine. Pineapples add a tropical twist to any dish and contain bromelain, which aids digestion. Kiwis, with their vibrant green flesh and unique texture, are packed with vitamin C and fiber. Avocados, although technically fruits, are celebrated for their creamy texture and healthy fats. Finally, blueberries, small but potent, are rich in antioxidants that contribute
         to overall health. Together, these fruits not only enhance our meals but also support our well-being in various ways.</p>
